# FastAPI Webinar

In October 2021, I did a [PyCharm webinar](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2021/10/webinar-smarter-fastapi-through-tooling-with-sebastian-ramirez/) with [Sebastián Ramírez](https://twitter.com/tiangolo/) the creator of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) and [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com).
The webinar code is largely based on the demo from the SQLModel tutorial -- along with a healthy dose of structure from the Talk Python Training course [Modern APIs with FastAPI](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/getting-started-with-fastapi) course.
But it's presented in a way to get the max out of tooling, in this case the IDE -- in this case, PyCharm Professional.

Here's the notes and code, maybe screenshots, hell maybe even videos.

:::{admonition} This repo is temporary!!
Once SQLModel gets live and PyCharm's support gets final, I'll move it to the PyCharm Guide.
