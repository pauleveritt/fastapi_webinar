# Make a FastAPI/Poetry Project

We're going to start with an empty project, letting PyCharm Professional help us get setup.
For this, we'll use Poetry as our Python interpreter.
The latest EAP bundles the Poetry plugin (works for Community Edition too.)

## Demo

- We'll start on the Welcome Screen.
- New Project
- Choose FastAPI as the project type
  - (*) As FastAPI gets popular, adoption drives tooling and DX
- Poetry as the interpreter type
- Once launched, full screen the window
- Enable Version Control Integration, check in, commit
- Show the run config's uvicorn setup and any Settings
  - (AK) The SMART way we do uvicorn and sniffing for the app
- The generated app actually doesn't do uvicorn import and .run()
  - (SR) ASGI as a standard and well-known tooling
- Run it, click on link
- Show /docs/ in browser
  - (SR) Integrating (deeply) with OpenAPI really opens up tooling
- Commit


## Discussion

- (SR) Any plans for knobs in `pyproject.toml`?
- (Both) The `8080`/`8088` conundrum, perhaps `pyproject.toml` and some standard?

## `main.py`

The Python "entry point" as generated by the PyCharm Professional scaffold.

```{literalinclude} main.py
```

## `test_main.http`

PyCharm Professional supports a Postman-like REST client with files containing a special grammar for generating requests.

```{literalinclude} test_main.http
```

## `pyproject.toml`

The Python package information used by Poetry et al. for configuration.

```{literalinclude} pyproject.toml
```
