# Start Heroes

Let's start implementing the Heroes tutorial from SQLModel, but first, just as Pydantic models.

- Tests first
  - Fail faster on typing and testing
- Write model in main.py, will extract later
- response_model with type hint in test
- Use debugger first to simulate confused
- Navigation and usages thanks to type hint on function args
- Heros -> Heroes
  - Refactor symbol name and type annotations
  - Including in Google Doc String
- Quick documentation inlay and Endpoints tab for docs
